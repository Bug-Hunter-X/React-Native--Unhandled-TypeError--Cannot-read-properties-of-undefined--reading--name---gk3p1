This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  It's especially common in React Native when dealing with asynchronous data fetching where the component tries to render before the data has fully loaded.

```javascript
// Example: Incorrect access of user.name before data loads
<Text>Welcome, {user.name}!</Text>
```
